 #### <img alt="img_8.png" height="35pcs" src="img_8.png" width="35pcs"/> If you are a user, you may concern:

- Q1: How to transfer my assets between two chains through Poly Bridge?
- A: Please refer to the manual (Link) below.
####
- Q2: How much fee does Poly Bridge charge per transaction?
- A: It depends on the network you are sending from and to. The fee paid via Poly Bridge is for covering gas fee charged by target chain. No extra fee will be charged by Poly Bridge.
####
- Q3: How long does it take per transaction?
- A: Average estimated time of arrival is 1-10 min. Irresistible factors such as network congestion might delay the transaction. If your transaction hasn’t been completed for a long time, please refer to Q7.
####
- Q4: Where can I find my previous transaction?
- A: You can check your previous transaction in "History".
####
- Q5: Is the bridge rate 1:1?
- A: Normally yes. Except deflationary tokens.
####
- Q6：When I encounter an error in the wallet, what can I do?
- A: 
  - Firstly, make sure you have approved enough amount for Poly Bridge contract to use the token.
  - Then, make sure you have sufficient native tokens to pay the gas fee on the source chain. Please be noted that the amount of native tokens should be excluded from the fee you paid for Poly Bridge and the amount you plan to transfer. For example, if you want to transfer $Metis from Andromeda to BSC, you have to reserve two portions of tokens: one for target chain gas fee, the other for source chain gas fee. The rest are tokens you can transfer. 
  - Besides, if you encounter other errors, please contact Poly Network team.
####
- Q7: I have waited a long time and still didn't receive my asset, what can I do?
- A: Please check which step your transaction has reached. Solutions vary from different steps, see below:
  - The transaction hasn't been completed on src chain：For safety reason, Poly Bridge will not confirm your transaction immediately until subsequent blocks have been confirmed (the number of subsequent blocks depending on different chains), please wait for block confirmation.
  - The transaction has been completed on src chain, but not completed in Poly: if the transaction has been stuck in this step for over 5 min, please do not hesitate to contact the Poly Network Team.
  - The transaction hasn't been completed on the target chain: it’s perhaps down to the transaction congestion of target chain, please wait for a while or refer to the accelerated transaction tutorial. If the accelerated tutorial doesn't work, please contact the Poly Network team.
####
- Q8: How can I check the status of my transaction?
- A: Click “History” in the Poly Bridge to find the transaction and then click “Status” to check the progress.
####
- Q9: Why does it show “sufficient liquidity” on the target chain before sending a transaction and “insufficient liquidity on the target chain after sending a transaction?
- A:  
  - Firstly, the liquidity shown on Poly Bridge is shared for all users. If there are several users making large transactions simultaneously, insufficient liquidity will appear. 
  - It happens when the amount you are transferring is close to the max available amount. Under this occasion, Poly Network will contact the relevant project to add liquidity as soon as possible. Please be patient.
####
- Q10: Can I use Poly Bridge by mobile phone?
- A: Of course, here is a manual (Link) for mobile users.
####
- Q11: When encountering an “unknown wallet error”, what can I do?
  -A: Please check whether the currently connected network is stable, which can be observed by switching nodes.
####
- Q12: I encountered an error and submitted an accelerated transaction…what’s next?
- A: 
  - Firstly, please do not submit accelerated transactions when you encounter an error. This error means the transaction hasn't been completed on the target chain. 
  - Then turn back to your wallet to check the balance. If you have not received it, please contact us.
