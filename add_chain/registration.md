<h1 align="center">Chain Registration</h1>



### New Chain Registration

After the registration process is complete and the Cross Chain Council approves the application, the chain officially becomes a part of the cross-chain ecosystem. The registration is accomplished using the trusted registered account by the poly team.

### Update Registered Chain

The registered account needs to send an update application to the relay chain. The **updateSideChain** method is used to send an application to update the registered information of a particular blockchain.



## Interface Methods Registration

Register header sync and cross-chain management method to relayer. So that relayer can call them for every cross-chain event. The interface method can be found in [Develop Guideline for Header Sync](guideline.md).
