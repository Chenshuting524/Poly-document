<h1 align="center">How to Join the Cross-Chain Ecosystem</h1>

The poly cross-chain ecosystem provides a platform for various chains to interact and transfer data and conduct cross-chain transactions. Any chain can freely join the ecosystem. However, the chains that support smart contracts can interact and share all kinds of information between chains, while the chains that do not support smart contracts are limited to cross-chain asset transfer.

## General Steps

Adding a new chain to poly involves three main phases:

- **Implementation**

  The smart contracts, chain registration interface method, block verification interface method, and relayer interface method.

- **Deployment and Registration** 

  Operations such as smart contract deployment, side chain registration, and relayer setup. Proceeded only by the poly team following general specifications. 

- **Initialization and Running**

  Perform specific actions like business contract call, cross-chain events handling based on the selected solution on poly nodes.

This section is intended for developers who want to help add a new chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem. Here is the outline that will be introduced:

- [The introduction and development specification of Smart Contract](contracts.md)
- [The introduction and development specification of New chain registration](reigstration.md)
- [The introduction and development specification of block data verification ](blockdata_verification.md)
- [The introduction and development specification of relayer](relayer.md)
