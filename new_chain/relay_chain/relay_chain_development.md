<h1 align="center">Develop for Poly Chain</h1>

## Requirements

### 1. Make sure the new chain supports Light Client Verification

The block header must contain the following informationï¼š
- Hash of the previous block header
- Merkle state root hash
- Necessary information to prove the legitimacy of the block header varying from different consensus mechanisms.

> [!Note|style:flat|label:Notice]
> If your chain doesn't support techniques like `Simple Payment Verification` (SPV) protocol in Bitcoin or `Light Ethereum Subprotocol` (LES) in Ethereum, please get in touch with the `poly team` via <a href="mailto:contact@poly.network">contact@poly.network</a> or https://t.me/polynetworkgroup for more support.

### 2. Offer the block header structure and verification methods
- Block header structure
- Serialization and Deserilization methods
- Block header verification mehtods

### 3. Offer the merkle tree structure, generation and verification methods

- Merkle tree structure
- State root generation, and verification methods

| --------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SyncGenesisHeader** | It stores and handles the initial block header so that the subsequent block headers of blocks that contain cross-chain events can be verified and synchronized. The method will only be called once for initializing the new chain; please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/native/service/header_sync/eth/header_sync.go#L61) for more details. |
| **SyncBlockHeader**   | Consistently synchronizes block cycle change and cross-chain transaction block headers from the new chain to the poly chain; please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/native/service/header_sync/eth/header_sync.go#L99) for more details.                                                                                                        |


#### Block Header Synchronization Entrance Method

| ------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SyncSideChainGenesisHeader** | It is the entrance method for synchronizing the genesis block header of the new chain to poly chain and synchronizing the genesis header of the poly chain to ccm contract of the new chain; please refer to the [code](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly-io-test/blob/master/cmd/tools/run.go#L607) for more details. |

The Key information for this method (submitted by .config):

- Service provider (endpoint) Url of the new chain

- Selected genesis block height

- Essential information for verifying genesis headers may exist in header information already or need to be fetched from block headers from other block height

- Information required for the new chain block header verification
