<h1 align="center">Import Assets</h1>
This part is mainly to help the project import assets into the Poly Network.

- Poly Network already supports most mainstream chains, check if your project supports existing [chains](../../Core_Smart_Contract/Contract/MainNet.md#contract-index-chain-chain-id).
- Both Token and NFT can be cross-chained on the Poly Network.
- Whether or not there is an asset on the target chain, Poly Network can help you complete it.
