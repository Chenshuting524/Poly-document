<h1 align="center">How to Join the Cross-Chain Ecosystem</h1>

The poly cross-chain ecosystem provides a platform for various chains to interact and transfer data and conduct cross-chain transactions. Any chain can freely join the ecosystem. However, the chains that support smart contracts can interact and transfer all kinds of information between chains, while the chains that do not support smart contracts are limited to cross-chain asset transfer. 

This Branch is intended for developers who want to help add a new chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem. Here is the outline that will be introduced:

- The overview of two scenarios for handling cross-chain events.
- The technical flow for adding a new side chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem.
- The features and attributes required for adding a new side chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem.
- The interface method needs to be implemented.
