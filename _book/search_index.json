Ecosystem","keywords":"","body":"How to Join the Cross-Chain Ecosystem\n\nThe poly cross-chain ecosystem provides a platform for various chains to interact and transfer data and conduct cross-chain transactions. Any chain can freely join the ecosystem. However, the chains that support smart contracts can interact and share all kinds of information between chains, while the chains that do not support smart contracts are limited to cross-chain asset transfer. \nThere are two scenarios for adding a new chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem: Header Sync and Consensus Vote. While Header Sync is more trustworthy and scalable, Consensus Vote is a backup plan when Header Sync is not applicable. It is crucial to know whether a chain can join poly using Header Sync, and the core is whether this chain has a mechanism for nodes like ethereum light client to verify transactions using block header information only. A more detailed explanation is in the first chapter of this branch.\nThis Branch is intended for developers who want to help add a new chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem, mainly for Header Sync Scenario because the Consensus Vote hardly needs any development. Here is the outline that will be introduced:\n\nThe overview of two scenarios for handling cross-chain events\nThe technical flow for adding a new side chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem\nThe features and attributes required for adding a new side chain to the poly cross-chain ecosystem\nThe interface method needs to be implemented\n\n"},"add_chain/scenario.html":{"url":"add_chain/scenario.html","title":"Two Scenarios","keywords":"","body":"Poly Cross-Chain Ecosystem Scenario\n\nPoly has two scenarios for verifying the transaction block and the cross-chain transaction information it carries:\n\nHeader Sync: Verify the block header based on the critical blockchain data such as validator set and their commitment, signature, mining difficulties. Verify the cross-chain transaction based on the corresponding Merkle proof of cross-chain events and transactions\nConsensus vote： Every Poly node act as a full node of the target blockchain, validating the blocks and cross-chain transactions following the rules of the side chain. The success of the cross-chain request depends on the consensus vote result of poly nodes\n\nConsensus Vote is not suggested for security and scalability reasons unless Header Sync can not be achieved. Here are two factors that determine the cross-chain event can be verified based on Header Sync:\n\nThe blockchain support Merkle proof for verifying transactions, whether it has Merkle tree generation and verification method for the ledger records or transactions. This allows the relay chain to determine the legitimacy of the transaction records.\nThe block headers have the validator set and their commitment or signature for verification. In other words, relayers who act as light clients can obtain the validator sets and their commitment or signature from only the block header information and ensure the legitimacy of the block headers.\n\nBlock Header Synchronization Scenario\nThe general steps for joining poly cross-chain ecosystem using header sync scenario are as follows:\n\nDeploy Contract CCM/CCMP/CCD/LockProxy/Wrapper or develop a specific interface that has the same functionality as a contract, for more details, see Chapter \"Core Smart Contract List\"(Attach a Link to smartcontractList.MD)\nRegister the chain, approve the registration by consensus vote.

These features are the critical elements for implementing the core interface method for handling block headers or cross-chain transactions.\nPlease note that this chapter is intended for the Header Sync scenario. There is no need to clarify these technical resources for blockchains where Header Sync is not applicable.\nRequirement List\nConsensus Algorithm\nThe Consensus Algorithm determines how blockchains select consensus validators,  voters, and block producers for minting new blocks and bookkeeping block transactions. The developers need to clearly understand the consensus protocol of the blockchain to get sufficient information for validating block headers.\nFor instance, for blockchains that use POS, one of the essential elements for verifying blocks are signatures from validator nodes, which requires the developers Know the consensus nodes' election process, and who are the consensus nodes in the next epoch.\nGenesis Block of the Chain\nThe genesis block's block header needs to be submitted to the consortium chain of the cross-chain ecosystem to verify the consequent transactions and block headers on this chain.\nBlock Header Structure and Verification Method \nThe block header verification and processing method and the block structure need to be submitted so that the relay chain can verify the block headers that will be transferred from this chain.\nThe side chain needs to provide its block header format, the serialization, and the deserialization methods. The mode of signature verification allows the relay chain to process and verify block headers.\nMerkle Tree Structure and Verification Method\nThe Merkle tree structure, the Merkle tree generation, and the verification method for the ledger records or transactions need to be submitted to the relay chain to verify cross-chain transactions from this chain. \nThe source chain stores cross-chain information and construct a Merkle tree, and then sends the Merkle tree root and the Merkle proof of the information to the side chain. The side chain verifies the proof using the Merkle root and confirms the validity of the cross-chain information.\nMerkle proofs are a solution. When events and transactions are recorded on the blockchain, a corresponding Merkle proof, by having a Merkle proof and the correct block header, we can prove that a particular transaction or event did occur on the chain with certainty.\nThe information relayed by the relayer includes cross-chain transaction proof and the subchain block header (following block header of the cross-chain transaction execution header) containing the state root of transaction proof. The poly chain will first verify the block header. Then the application state root within the block header can help confirm the validity of transaction proof (indicating the cross-chain request is successfully executed on the side chain) and obtain the actual cross-chain transaction message. \n"},"add_chain/steps.html":{"url":"add_chain/steps.html","title":"Common Steps","keywords":"","body":"Technical Flow in Header Sync Scenario\n\n\nOverview\nAdding a new chain to poly involves three main parts:\n\nInitialization includes smart contract deployment and new chain registration. \nRegister core interface to poly relayer.\nSync genesis header involves synchronizing a  side chain initial header to poly relay chain and synchronizing poly genesis header to the ccm contract deployed on the side chain.\n\nPart of these steps now proceeded only by the poly team following general specifications.

The user sends a cross chain request from chain A by invoking a dApp's cross chain interface, and on the target chain B the dApp's smart contract executes the necessary logic to produce the final result. Chain A and B implement the two contracts and other necessary interfaces, and anyone can develop an infrastructure for dApps around the cross chain management contract. The contracts deployed on chain A and chain B make up a complete cross chain dApp.\nThe complete process flow from chain A to chain B is as follows:\n\nThe user invokes the service contract on chain A, which then in turn invokes the cross chain management contract. The management contract transfers the parameters to the target chain and a cross chain transaction is created by management contract which is sent to the target chain based on block generation on chain A;\nSince there is no means of automatic data exchange between two chains, a relayer needs to be set up to transfer block header details from chain A to the relay chain's block header synchronization contract. It also fetches the management contract's response event from chain A which encapsulates the parameters passed by the user, and also fetches the merkle proof. Next, it groups this information together and sends it to the cross chain management contract.\nThe management contract fetches the block headers from chain A, verifies whether or not the cross chain parameters and the proof are valid, and then transmits the necessary information to chain B in the form of an event;\nChain B's relayer transfers the relay chain's block headers to chain B's block header synchronization contract. The relevant chain B cross chain transaction parameters and respective merkle proofs are fetched from the ledger records of the relay chain and transmitted to chain B's cross chain management contract;\nThe management contract of chain B determines the legitimacy of the cross chain transaction information and then invokes the relevant target contract and completes the cross chain contract invocation;\n\nThere are two different merkle proofs that are transferred to the relay chain:\n\nThe merkle proof that is used to verify the legitimacy of cross chain transactions from chain A\nThe merkle proof that is used to ensure that a transaction has been created and has occurred on the relay chain\n\nThese merkle proofs help establish a trust mechanism for the cross chain ecosystem.
